🚀 Building a Vision Transformer Model from Scratch with PyTorch 🎯

Curious about how Vision Transformers (ViTs) are reshaping the world of computer vision? 🌍

 I recently dove deep into the mechanics of Vision Transformers and decided to build one from scratch using PyTorch—no pre-built libraries, just pure PyTorch magic. ✨

In this project, I:

 🔎 Explored the core components of Vision Transformers: Patch Embeddings, Multi-Head Self-Attention, Positional Encodings, and MLPs

 ⚙️ Implemented each block step-by-step with clean, modular PyTorch code

 📊 Trained the model on an image classification task using the CIFAR-10 dataset (a classic benchmark in computer vision!)

 💡 Gained a deeper understanding of how Transformers process visual data

If you're also passionate about deep learning, vision models, or just love the idea of building things from the ground up, I'd love to connect and discuss! 💬
